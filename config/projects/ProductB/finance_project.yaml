# Configuration notes:
# 1. Replace all placeholder values with your organization's details
# 2. Capacity ID should match your Fabric capacity
# 3. Git repository should be accessible with your credentials
# 4. Principal IDs: Use Object IDs (GUIDs) for Users, Groups and Service Principals
# 5. Remove sections you don't need (e.g., if no Git integration needed)
