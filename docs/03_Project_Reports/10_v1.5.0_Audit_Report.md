# Project Audit Report: v1.5.0

**Date**: 2026-02-02
**Target**: `usf-fabric-cli-cicd` (v1.5.0)
**Auditor**: Antigravity

## 1. Executive Summary

The project is in a healthy state having matured from the v0.3.x series to v1.5.0. The version drift issues identified in Jan 2026 have been resolved. The core CLI and Webapp components are well-structured with clear dependency isolation.

## 2. Version & Configuration

| Component | Version | Status |
|-----------|---------|--------|
| `pyproject.toml` | 1.5.0 | ✅ Aligned |
| `CHANGELOG.md` | 1.5.0 | ✅ Aligned |
| `README.md` | (Derived) | ✅ Aligned |

**Finding**: The project successfully transitioned from the identified v0.3.25 drift to a consistent v1.5.0 release.

## 3. Git Status & Codebase

**Branch**: `main`
**Status**: Dirty (1 file modified) — *at time of audit*

### Uncommitted Changes

> [!NOTE]
> **Resolved** — This fix was committed in a subsequent session. The trailing-slash issue was caused by a 307 redirect mismatch in the FastAPI backend and was addressed in v1.6.0 (see CHANGELOG).

- `webapp/frontend/src/lib/api.ts`:

  ```diff
  - const response = await fetch(`${API_BASE}/search?${params}`)
  + const response = await fetch(`${API_BASE}/search/?${params}`)
  ```

  **Analysis**: This change adds a trailing slash to the search endpoint, fixing a redirection issue (307 Temporary Redirect) on the backend.

## 4. Architecture & Dependencies

### Core CLI (`/`)

- **Type**: Python Package (Setuptools)
- **Environment**: Conda (`fabric-cli-cicd`)
- **Key Dependencies**:
  - `microsoft/fabric-cli` @ v1.3.1 (Pinned via Git)
  - `typer`, `rich`, `azure-identity`
- **Observations**: dependency pinning for the core `fabric-cli` is excellent for stability but requires manual maintenance to stay current with Microsoft releases.

### Webapp (`/webapp`)

- **Architecture**: Split Stack
  - **Backend**: FastAPI (Python)
  - **Frontend**: React + Vite (TypeScript)
- **Dependencies**:
  - Backend: `fastapi`, `uvicorn`, `pydantic` (Minimal, Clean)
  - Frontend: `radix-ui`, `tailwindcss`, `react-query` (Modern Stack)
- **Observations**: The webapp is a distinct sub-project with its own build lifecycle (`make docker-build`). It includes an Interactive Architecture Guide added in v1.6.3.

## 5. Documentation Status

- **Coverage**: High.
- **Key Documents**:
  - `README.md`: Comprehensive entry point.
  - `webapp/README.md`: Detailed interactive guide.
  - `docs/`: Structured sub-folders for Guides, Strategy, and Reports.

## 6. Recommendations *(Status as of v1.7.0)*

1. ~~**Commit the Frontend Fix**~~ — ✅ Resolved in v1.6.0.
2. ~~**Verify Tests**~~ — ✅ 188 tests passing as of v1.7.0.
3. **Dependency Check**: Verify if `microsoft/fabric-cli` has a newer version than v1.3.1 that offers critical features, though upgrading is low priority if stable.
