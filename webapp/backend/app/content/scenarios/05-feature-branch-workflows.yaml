    title: Why Feature Branch Workspaces?
    type: info
    content: |
      Feature branch workflows allow developers to work in **isolated workspaces** 
      without affecting the shared development environment.
      
      ## Key Benefits
      
      | Benefit | Description |
      |---------|-------------|
      | **Isolation** | Your changes don't break other developers' work |
      | **Integration Testing** | Full testing before merge to main |
      | **Stakeholder Review** | Share a live workspace for demos |
      | **Parallel Development** | Multiple features developed simultaneously |
      | **Risk Reduction** | Problems stay contained to feature workspace |
      
      ## How It Works
      
      1. You have a main workspace: `acme-sales-dev`
      2. You create a feature branch: `feature/inventory-opt`
      3. Framework creates: `acme-sales-feature-inventory-opt-dev`
      4. You develop/test in isolation
      5. After merge, you destroy the feature workspace
      
      ## Commands Overview
      
      | Purpose | Command |
      |---------|---------|
      | Deploy feature workspace | `make docker-feature-deploy config=... env=dev branch=feature/x` |
      | Local feature deploy | `fabric-cicd deploy <config> --env dev --branch feature/x --force-branch-workspace` |
      | Destroy feature workspace | `fabric-cicd destroy <config> --env dev --branch feature/x` |
      | Bulk cleanup | `make bulk-destroy file=list.txt` |
    tips:
      - Feature workspaces clone the dev environment configuration
      - Always clean up feature workspaces after merging to save capacity

    title: "Step 1: Create Your Feature Branch"
    type: command
    content: |
      Start with standard Git workflow - create a feature branch from main.
      
      ## Naming Convention
      
      | Pattern | Example | Best For |
      |---------|---------|----------|
      | `feature/*` | `feature/inventory-opt` | New functionality |
      | `bugfix/*` | `bugfix/data-load` | Bug fixes |
      | `hotfix/*` | `hotfix/urgent-fix` | Production fixes |
      | `refactor/*` | `refactor/cleanup` | Code improvements |
    code:
      language: bash
      content: |
        # Ensure you're on the main branch and up to date
        git checkout main
        git pull origin main
        
        # Create your feature branch
        git checkout -b feature/inventory-optimization
        
        # Push the branch to remote (required for Git integration)
        git push -u origin feature/inventory-optimization
        
        # Verify your branch
        git branch --show-current
    expected_output: |
      Switched to branch 'main'
      Already up to date.
      Switched to a new branch 'feature/inventory-optimization'
      Total 0 (delta 0), reused 0 (delta 0)
      To https://dev.azure.com/org/project/_git/repo
       * [new branch]      feature/inventory-optimization -> feature/inventory-optimization
      Branch 'feature/inventory-optimization' set up to track remote branch
      
      feature/inventory-optimization
    tips:
      - Keep branch names short (they become part of workspace names)
      - Avoid special characters - use hyphens, not underscores
      - Fabric workspace names have a maximum length limit

  - id: docker-feature-deploy
    title: "Step 2: Deploy Feature Workspace (Docker - RECOMMENDED)"
    type: command
    content: |
      The easiest way to deploy a feature workspace is using the Docker command:
      
      ## Command Syntax
      
      ```bash
      make docker-feature-deploy config=<path> env=<env> branch=<branch>
      ```
      
      ## Parameters
      
      | Parameter | Required | Description |
      |-----------|----------|-------------|
      | `config` | ✓ | Path to your project YAML config |
      | `env` | ✓ | Target environment (dev, staging, prod) |
      | `branch` | ✓ | Your feature branch name |
    code:
      language: bash
      content: |
        # Deploy feature workspace using Docker (RECOMMENDED)
        make docker-feature-deploy \
          config=config/projects/acme_corp/sales_analytics.yaml \
          env=dev \
          branch=feature/inventory-optimization
        
        # If using a different env file
        make docker-feature-deploy \
          config=config/projects/acme_corp/sales_analytics.yaml \
          env=dev \
          branch=feature/inventory-optimization \
          ENVFILE=.env.dev

      If you prefer local deployment (not Docker), use the CLI directly:
      
      ## CLI Flags for Feature Branches
      
      | Flag | Description |
      |------|-------------|
      | `--branch` | Specifies the feature branch name |
      | `--force-branch-workspace` | Creates a separate workspace for this branch |
    code:
      language: bash
      content: |
        # Option A: Using fabric-cicd CLI directly
        fabric-cicd deploy \
          config/projects/acme_corp/sales_analytics.yaml \
          --env dev \
          --branch feature/inventory-optimization \
          --force-branch-workspace
        
        # Option B: Using Python module directly
        export PYTHONPATH="${PYTHONPATH}:$(pwd)/src"
        python -m core.cli deploy \
          config/projects/acme_corp/sales_analytics.yaml \

    tips:
      - "`--force-branch-workspace` is REQUIRED for feature branches"
      - Without this flag, it would try to deploy to the shared dev workspace

  - id: workspace-naming
    title: "Understanding Workspace Naming"
    type: info
    content: |
      The framework automatically generates workspace names from your branch:
      
      ## Naming Pattern
      
      ```
      {base-workspace-name}-{branch-slug}-{environment}
      ```
      
      ## Branch Slug Transformation
      
      Your branch name is transformed:
      - "Slashes (`/`) → Hyphens (`-`)"
      - "Underscores (`_`) → Hyphens (`-`)"
      - Converted to lowercase
      
      ## Examples
      
      | Base Workspace | Branch | Environment | Generated Name |
      |----------------|--------|-------------|----------------|
      | acme-sales | feature/inventory-opt | dev | acme-sales-feature-inventory-opt-dev |
      | acme-sales | feature/new-reports | dev | acme-sales-feature-new-reports-dev |
      | acme-sales | bugfix/data-load | dev | acme-sales-bugfix-data-load-dev |
      | acme-sales | hotfix/123 | prod | acme-sales-hotfix-123-prod |
      | analytics | refactor/cleanup | staging | analytics-refactor-cleanup-staging |
      
      ## Length Considerations
      
      - Fabric workspace names have a maximum length
      - Keep branch names SHORT to avoid truncation
      - Recommend: Branch names under 25 characters
    tips:
      - "The naming logic is in `src/core/git_integration.py`"
      - Predictable naming makes it easy to find workspaces

      ## Development Activities
      
      | Activity | Safe? | Notes |
      |----------|-------|-------|
      | Add new notebooks | ✅ | Won't affect shared dev |
      | Modify pipelines | ✅ | Test changes freely |
      | Change lakehouse schema | ✅ | No impact on others |
      | Test new Fabric features | ✅ | Experiment safely |
      | Break things | ✅ | It's YOUR sandbox |
      
      ## Testing Activities
      
      | Test Type | Description |
      |-----------|-------------|
      | Integration | End-to-end pipeline runs |
      | Data Quality | Validate transformations |
      | Performance | Load testing |
      | UAT | User acceptance with stakeholders |
      
      ## Collaboration
      
      - Share the workspace URL with your team
      - Stakeholders can view in Fabric portal
      - Pair programming in shared notebooks
    tips:
      - Changes in feature workspace DON'T sync back to main
      - When ready, merge your Git branch (code), not the workspace

    title: "Capacity Planning for Feature Branches"
    type: info
    content: |
      Each feature workspace consumes Fabric capacity. Plan accordingly!
      
      ## Capacity Guidelines
      
      | Capacity SKU | Concurrent Feature Workspaces | Notes |
      |--------------|-------------------------------|-------|
      | Trial (F2) | 2-3 | Very limited, clean up frequently |
      | F4 | 3-5 | Small team |
      | F8 | 5-10 | Medium team |
      | F16 | 10-20 | Large team |
      | F64+ | 20+ | Enterprise scale |
      
      ## Best Practices
      
      | Practice | Why |
      |----------|-----|
      | Short-lived branches | Less capacity usage |
      | Auto-cleanup on PR merge | Prevents orphaned workspaces |
      | Weekly bulk cleanup | Catches missed cleanups |
      | Clear naming convention | Easy to identify stale workspaces |
      | Resource limits | Prevent runaway capacity |
      
      ## Check Your Capacity Usage
    code:
      language: bash
      content: |
        # List all workspaces to see how many exist
        python scripts/utilities/list_workspaces.py | wc -l
        
        # Count feature workspaces specifically
        python scripts/utilities/list_workspaces.py | grep "feature-" | wc -l
        
        # List all with details
        python scripts/utilities/list_workspaces.py
    warnings:
      - Too many feature workspaces can exhaust capacity
      - Set team policies for maximum concurrent feature branches
      - Consider capacity costs in sprint planning

      You've mastered feature branch workflows!
      
      ## What You've Accomplished
      
      - ✅ Create feature branches with proper naming
      - "✅ Deploy isolated workspaces with `make docker-feature-deploy`"
      - ✅ Understand automatic workspace naming conventions
      - "✅ Verify workspaces with `list_workspaces.py`"
      - "✅ Destroy individual workspaces with `fabric-cicd destroy`"
      - "✅ Bulk cleanup with `make bulk-destroy`"
      - ✅ CI/CD integration for automated lifecycle
      - ✅ Capacity planning considerations
      
      ## Command Quick Reference
      
      | Task | Command |
      |------|---------|
      | Deploy feature (Docker) | `make docker-feature-deploy config=... env=dev branch=feature/x` |
      | Deploy feature (local) | `fabric-cicd deploy <config> --env dev --branch feature/x --force-branch-workspace` |
      | Destroy feature | `fabric-cicd destroy <config> --env dev --branch feature/x` |
      | List workspaces | `python scripts/utilities/list_workspaces.py` |
      | Filter features | `python scripts/utilities/list_workspaces.py \| grep "feature-"` |
      | Bulk destroy | `make bulk-destroy file=list.txt` |
